Our mission is to inspire a new era of connectivity, joy, and celebration, where technology serves as the catalyst for unforgettable moments and endless possibilities.  

## Project Details  
Our project consists of a remote-controlled car that can connect to a phone/computer to play music and is controlled by a computer remotely. This car can be driven around or turned into autonomous mode to let the party go on without anyone controlling the car.  

- **Autonomous Mode**:  
  The autonomous mode uses the ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and maneuver around them. If there are no obstacles in the robot's way, it continues to drive in a straight line.  

- **Design**:  
  - Three wheels: Two motor-powered back wheels and one front wheel for steering.  
  - **Bluetooth Speaker**: Connected to the Raspberry Pi for music playback.  
  - **Blinking Light Strip**: Added for enhanced party fun.  

- **Power Supply**:  
  - The Raspberry Pi and speaker are powered by a power bank.  
  - The motors and lights are powered by a battery pack.  
  - The battery pack and power bank are stacked to fit onto the car.  

- **Motor Driver**:  
  - Allows the motors to run and is attached to the bottom of the car.  

- **Code**:  
  - The project is powered by code stored and executed on the Raspberry Pi.
